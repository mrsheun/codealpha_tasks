Music Genre Prediction from Song Features
Overview

This project involved a comprehensive data analysis pipeline to build a machine learning model capable of predicting the genre of a song based on its audio features. The process encompassed data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model training, model evaluation, and finally, deployment of the trained model as a user-friendly web application using Render.

The primary goal was to create a tool that allows anyone to input song characteristics and receive an instant prediction of its genre. This can be beneficial for music enthusiasts, playlist creators, and anyone curious about the underlying patterns in music.

Data Analysis Steps

1.  Data Loading and Initial Exploration:
     The project began by loading a dataset containing various audio features of songs (e.g., tempo, energy, danceability, acousticness, etc.) along with their corresponding genres.
     Pandas library in Python was used for efficient data manipulation and loading from a CSV file (or similar format).
      Initial exploration involved examining the dataset's structure, data types, and identifying any missing values or inconsistencies.
      Basic statistical summaries (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) were calculated to understand the distribution of the features.

2.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    Visualizations were created using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to gain deeper insights into the data.
      Feature Distributions: Histograms and box plots were used to visualize the distribution of individual audio features for different genres. This helped in understanding how feature values vary across genres.
      Relationships Between Features: Scatter plots and pair plots were generated to explore the relationships between different audio features. Correlation matrices were calculated and visualized using heatmaps to quantify these relationships.
      Genre Distribution: A bar chart was used to visualize the distribution of songs across different genres in the dataset, highlighting any class imbalances.
      Insights Gained: EDA revealed key differences in feature distributions across genres, potential correlations between features, and the overall composition of the dataset in terms of genre representation. These insights informed subsequent data preprocessing and model selection steps.

3.  Data Preprocessing:
   Handling Missing Values: Strategies were applied to handle any missing data, such as imputation (filling with mean, median, or mode) or removal of rows/columns with excessive missing values.
   Feature Scaling: Numerical features were scaled using techniques like StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler to ensure that features with larger ranges do not disproportionately influence the model training process. This is crucial for many machine learning algorithms.
   Label Encoding: The categorical genre labels were converted into numerical representations using Label Encoding from scikit-learn. This is necessary as most machine learning models work with numerical input. The mapping between numerical labels and original genres was saved for later interpretation of predictions.

4.  Model Training:
    The preprocessed data was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
      One or more machine learning classification models were trained to predict the song genre. Examples of models that might have been used include:
      Logistic Regression: A linear model suitable for binary and multi-class classification.
      The chosen model(s) were trained on the training data using the features as input and the encoded genre labels as the target variable.

5.  Model Evaluation:
    The trained model(s) were evaluated on the testing data to assess their performance on unseen examples.
    * Key evaluation metrics used include:
      Accuracy:The overall percentage of correctly predicted genres.
      Precision: The ability of the model to avoid false positives for each genre.
      Recall:The ability of the model to correctly identify all instances of each genre.
      F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure.
      Confusion Matrix: A table that visualizes the model's predictions against the actual genres, highlighting which genres are often confused.
     The model with the best performance based on these metrics was selected for deployment.

6.  Model Persistence:
     The trained and evaluated machine learning model, along with the fitted Label Encoder, were saved using the `joblib` library in Python. This allows for easy loading and reuse of the model without retraining. The saved files were named `genre_prediction_model.joblib` and `label_encoder.joblib`.

 Deployment with Render

Render ([https://render.com](https://render.com)) was chosen as the platform to deploy the trained music genre prediction model as a user-accessible web application. Render provides a straightforward and efficient way to deploy web applications and services from Git repositories.

Steps to Deploy with Render:

1.  Code Preparation: A Flask (or Streamlit) web application was developed in Python (`alpha_code.py` or `app.py`). This application includes:
     Loading the saved `genre_prediction_model.joblib` and `label_encoder.joblib` files.
     Defining routes to handle user input (song features) through a web form.
     Implementing the logic to receive user input, preprocess it (scaling using the loaded scaler if applicable, encoding if necessary), use the loaded model to make a genre prediction, and display the prediction to the user.
      HTML templates (`index.html`, `result.html`) were created to provide the user interface for input and displaying results.

2.  Repository Setup: All the project files, including the Python application code (`alpha_code.py` or `app.py`), the saved model (`genre_prediction_model.joblib`), the saved label encoder (`label_encoder.joblib`), the `templates` folder containing HTML files, and a `requirements.txt` file listing all the necessary Python libraries (Flask/Streamlit, pandas, scikit-learn, joblib, numpy, gunicorn if using Flask), were organized in a GitHub repository.

3.  Render Service Creation:
     A new web service was created on the Render dashboard, connecting it to the GitHub repository containing the project files.
   Render automatically detected the Python environment based on the presence of a `requirements.txt` file.

4.  Configuration:
   Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt` was specified to instruct Render to install all the required Python dependencies.
    Start Command:
         For Flask: `gunicorn app:app` (assuming your Flask application instance is named `app` in `app.py`).
        For Streamlit: `streamlit run alpha_code.py`.
    Environment Variables (if needed):** Any necessary environment variables were configured.
     Working Directory: The working directory was set to the root of the repository.

5.  Deployment: Render automatically built and deployed the application based on the provided configuration whenever changes were pushed to the connected GitHub repository.

6.   Access: Render provided a unique live URL (e.g., `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`) through which users can access the deployed web application.
