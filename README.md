# Music Data Analysis using Clustering
## Overview

This project analyzes a music dataset using the K-Means clustering algorithm to identify distinct groups of songs based on their characteristics. The primary focus of the analysis is to compare songs across different clusters based on the following audio features:

* **Popularity:** A measure of how popular a track is.
* **Valence:** A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness (e.g., happy, cheerful, euphoric) conveyed by a track.
* **Liveliness:** Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveliness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live.

The goal of this analysis is to segment the music data into meaningful clusters and understand the typical popularity and valence levels within each cluster.
## Methodology

1.  Data Loading and Exploration: The music dataset was loaded using a suitable data manipulation library; Pandas in Python. Initial exploration likely involved examining the data structure, checking for missing values, and understanding the distribution of the key features (`popularity`, `valence`, `liveliness`).

2.  Feature Selection: The analysis focused on the numerical columns related to song characteristics, specifically `popularity` and `valence`. While `liveliness` was mentioned in the initial analysis scope, the provided code snippet only uses `popularity` and `valence` for clustering.

3.  K-Means Clustering: The K-Means algorithm from scikit-learn (`sklearn.cluster.KMeans`) was employed to group the songs into a predefined number of clusters (in this case, `n_clusters=5`).

    ```python
    from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5)
    kmeans.fit(df[["popularity", "valence"]])
    cluster_labels = kmeans.labels_
    cluster_centers = kmeans.cluster_centers_
    ```

4.  Cluster Center Interpretation:* The `cluster_centers_` attribute of the fitted K-Means model provides the centroid of each cluster in the feature space. The output `[[-0.43763979 -0.97452165] ...]` represents the scaled average `popularity` and `valence` values for each of the 5 clusters. Note that these values are likely after standardization or normalization of the original data.

5.  Cluster Assignment: The `labels_` attribute assigns each data point (song) to one of the identified clusters. The "First few rows with Cluster labels" section shows the cluster assignment for the initial songs in the dataset.

    ```
       popularity  valence  Cluster
    0        27.0    0.759        2
    1        31.0    0.531        2
    2        28.0    0.333        0
    3        34.0    0.270        0
    4        32.0    0.323        0
    ```

6.  Cluster Size Analysis: The number of songs belonging to each cluster was calculated to understand the distribution of the data points across the identified groups. The output shows the size of each cluster:

    
    Clusters
    4    12692
    2    11366
    0    11206
    1    10583
    3     4107

7.  Original Feature Scale Cluster Centers (Potentially): The second array `[[28.58955878,  0.42611379], ...]` represents the cluster centers transformed back to the original scale of `popularity` and `valence`. This provides a more interpretable view of the average feature values for each cluster.

Results

The K-Means algorithm successfully partitioned the music data into 5 distinct clusters based on the `popularity` and `valence` features.

1. Cluster 0: (Based on `[[-0.6545811   0.90084345]]` in scaled data and potentially `[[28.58955878,  0.42611379]]` in original scale) - Contains 11206 songs. Characterized by relatively lower popularity and moderate valence.
2. Cluster 1: (Based on `[ 0.84605829  0.98512044]` in scaled data and potentially `[[53.78485688,  0.47425609]]` in original scale) - Contains 10583 songs. Represents songs with higher popularity and higher valence.
3. Cluster 2: (Based on `[[-0.43763979 -0.97452165]]` in scaled data and potentially `[[40.76972905,  0.4579001 ]]` in original scale) - Contains 11366 songs. Shows moderate popularity and lower valence.
4. Cluster 3: (Based on `[ 0.86340777 -0.5260356 ]]` in scaled data and potentially `[[66.95168415,  0.49384502]]` in original scale) - Contains 4107 songs. Indicates songs with the highest popularity and moderate valence.
5. Cluster 4: (Based on `[-1.84096891 -0.73851505]` in scaled data and potentially `[[10.4873461 ,  0.36790503]]` in original scale) - Contains the largest number of songs (12692). Represents songs with the lowest popularity and relatively low valence.

Note on Liveliness: While the initial analysis scope mentioned `liveliness`, it was not directly used in the K-Means clustering based on the provided code. Further analysis could involve exploring the `liveliness` distribution within these clusters to see if any patterns emerge.

Further Work

Visualization:I visualized the clusters in a 2D scatter plot of `popularity` vs. `valence`, with different colors representing the clusters.
Optimal Number of Clusters: Explore methods like the Elbow method or Silhouette analysis to determine if 5 is the optimal number of clusters for this data.
Additional Features: Incorporate other relevant audio features from the dataset into the clustering process to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the music data.
Cluster Interpretation: Provide more descriptive labels for each cluster based on their characteristics (e.g., "High-Energy Popular Tracks", "Low-Popularity Sad Songs").

Code

The core Python code used for the clustering analysis is as follows:

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'df' is your Pandas DataFrame containing the music data
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5)
kmeans.fit(df[["popularity", "valence"]])
cluster_labels = kmeans.labels_
cluster_centers_scaled = kmeans.cluster_centers_

# To get cluster sizes:
cluster_counts = pd.Series(cluster_labels).value_counts().sort_index()
print("Clusters")
print(cluster_counts)

# Assuming 'scaler' was used for feature scaling (e.g., StandardScaler)
# If so, you can inverse transform the cluster centers to the original scale:
# cluster_centers_original_scale = scaler.inverse_transform(cluster_centers_scaled)
# print(cluster_centers_original_scale)
